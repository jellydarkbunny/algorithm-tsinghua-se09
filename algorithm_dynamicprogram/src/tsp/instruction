	The Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a problem in combinatorial optimization 
studied in operations research and theoretical computer science. Given a list of 
cities and their pairwise distances, the task is to find a shortest possible tour 
that visits each city exactly once.

	The problem was first formulated as a mathematical problem in 1930 and is one of
the most intensively studied problems in optimization. It is used as a benchmark for 
many optimization methods. Even though the problem is computationally difficult, a 
large number of heuristics and exact methods are known, so that some instances with 
tens of thousands of cities can be solved.

	The TSP has several applications even in its purest formulation, such as planning, 
logistics, and the manufacture of microchips. Slightly modified, it appears as a 
sub-problem in many areas, such as DNA sequencing. In these applications, the concept 
city represents, for example, customers, soldering points, or DNA fragments, and the 
concept distance represents travelling times or cost, or a similarity measure between 
DNA fragments. In many applications, additional constraints such as limited resources 
or time windows make the problem considerably harder.

	In the theory of computational complexity, the decision version of TSP belongs to 
the class of NP-complete problems. Thus, it is assumed that there is no efficient 
algorithm for solving TSPs. In other words, it is likely that the worst case running 
time for any algorithm for TSP increases exponentially with the number of cities, so 
even some instances with only hundreds of cities will take many CPU years to solve 
exactly.
